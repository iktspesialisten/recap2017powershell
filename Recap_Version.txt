This is v.0.0.1 of the recap i am making for repeating some of the stuff i was into 1 year ago.
The jul_recap2017 was started on 07.07.2018 and is intended for recaping some things from when
i was very into powershell scripting in the period from january to july in 2018.. I was very
active at that time but i have been forgetting stuff since i have not been actively using 
PowerShell, so this will be kind of a beginner - immidiate scripting, though i was into some
advanced stuff also at that time.

Lets see how far i get with this and maybe i will take some time doing some advanced stuff too..

I will order the scripts from 01, 02, 03 and up.

As mentioned above the Recap i started on was started 07.07.2018. At the time the process is half
way done and its now 10.07.2018.
